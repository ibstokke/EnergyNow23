# Ancillary Services Calculator

The aim of this application is to provide comparision of income for a power plant offering different ancillary services in Switzerland.

The application takes a simple input which can be applied to any power plant: 

- Maximal Capacity P<sub>min</sub>
- Minimal Capacity P<sub>max</sub>
- Annual Reservoir Capacity Res

And converts calculates the most profitable mode of operation using:

1. [Electricity Production only](#ElProd)
2. [Electricity Production and Primary Control Reserves](#PRL)
3. [Selection Algorithm](#SelAlg)

For calculation application uses datasets:
- [EPEX Spot Market D-1 Hourly Prices](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/transmission-domain/r2/dayAheadPrices/show?name=&defaultValue=true&viewType=TABLE&areaType=BZN&atch=false&dateTime.dateTime=02.12.2023+00:00|CET|DAY&biddingZone.values=CTY|10YCH-SWISSGRIDZ!BZN|10YCH-SWISSGRIDZ&resolution.values=PT60M&dateTime.timezone=CET_CEST&dateTime.timezone_input=CET+(UTC+1)+/+CEST+(UTC+2))
- [Swissgrid Auction Results for Control Power](https://www.swissgrid.ch/en/home/customers/topics/ancillary-services/tenders.html)

The electricity prices $S_{el}$ have resolution of 1 hour. Primary Control Power tenders $P_{PRL}$ are however resolved on periods of 4 hours: t = {00:00-04:00 , 04:00-08:00, 08:00-12:00, 12:00-16:00, 16:00-20:00, 20:00-24:00}

For cost comparision, the income from electricity production at those time periods is summed up:

## Electricity Production Only <a name="ElProd"></a>

### Assumptions:
- Fixed operating cost of a power plant. This value does not vary between the operation modes and therefore is not considered for calculations​
- Reservoir is constant for the year​. No inflow/losses.
- Using datasets from the past: It is however possible to run the application on forecasts. 
- No inflation



Operating Capacity P can be freely choosen between P<sub>min</sub> < P < P<sub>max</sub> with resolution of 1MW:

The prices of electricity S<sub>el</sub> vary on hourly basis. For each hour the income from the electricity production is $$C_{el}(P) = S_{el} * P $$

## Selection Algorithm: 
The most profitable mode of operating is operting the plant at times when the income is maximal while reservoir usage minimal. Case of electricity production only is straightforward, as income curves are linear. The time periods with the highest electricity prices $S_{el}$ are most profitable. The algorithm first sorts the dataset from highest $S_{el}$ to lowest, than chooses $C_{el}(P_{max})$ until reservoir is used up: 

```python
    #order the result table containing the electricity prices
    
    result_df = result_df.sort_values(by=['C', 'B'], ascending=False)
    result_df = result_df.reset_index(drop=True)
    
    #iterate throgh rows
    for index, row in result_df.iterrows():
        #break statements to do not overexceed the table size
        if (index >= len(result_df)):
            break    
        #stop if the reservoir is empty
        if (res < p1.P_min):
            break
        #dont operate the power plant if the prices are negative 
        if (p1.P_max*row['S_el'] <= 0)
            break
        #if you cannot opearate at full capacity, discharge the entire reservoir 
        elif (res <= p1.P_max):
            result_df.at[index, 'In_el'] =  p1.reservoir * row['S_el'] 
            result_df.at[index, 'P_el'] =  p1.reservoir
            res = 0
        #if possible operate at maximal capacity
        else:
            result_df.at[index, 'In_el'] = p1.P_max*row['S_el'] 
            result_df.at[index, 'P_el'] = p1.P_max
            res -= p1.P_max

```

## Electricity Production and Primary Control Reserves <a name="PRL"></a>

### Assumptions
- ONE price for Primary Control Reserves (PRL): price-as-clear: highest accepted bidder sets the price.
- While offering PRL, the downwards and upwards regulation contribute equally. While operating at given capacity $P$ those contributions add up to zero: no reservoir is used up.

PRL regulation is symmetric. The maximal PRL capacity that can be offered is given by the minimal difference between the operating capacity and either maximal and minimal capcity: 

![Screenshot](FigurePlots/PRLProd.png)

With given price for PRL $S_{PRL}, thehe maximal income from PRL at given capacity P is described by the expression $P_{PRL} \cdot max(P-P_{min}, P_{max}-P)$.

**As no reservoir is used up, it is always most profitable to offer maximal PRL capacity whenever possible**

The total income is given by the sum electricity production and primary control reserves:
$$S_{PRL}(P) =  S_{el} * P_{el} + S_{PRL} \cdot max(P-P_{min}, P_{max}-P)$$


![Screenshot](FigurePlots/PRLIncome.png)

The bent in the income curve is caused by the fact that the PRL band is maximal at $P_{min} + P_{max} / 2$, and decreases symmetricly away from this point until decreasing to zero at $P_{min}$ and $P_{max}$, where only electricity production can be obtained.
